                    <p class="paragraph-align-left container">
                        Used mostly as a social media for the common man TikTok has begun to add corporations and
                        politicians to its platform. The application started off as a sort of revamped karaoke machine,
                        encouraging informality and the combination of song and video. Not the sort of place you would
                        find organizations who have traditionally tried to maintain a formal presence. So you can see
                        why seeing a major organizations mascot twerking dressed as Shrek has made people pause. The
                        motivations for such an act I would argue, seem to be deeply rooted in various forms of
                        convergence that have garnered both respect and trepidation to the company and changed the
                        culture of professional relationships between the public and companies.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph-align-left container">
                        In his book Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide, Henry Jenkins says talking
                        about our society, “In this emerging media system, what might traditionally be understood as
                        media producers and consumers are transformed into participants who are expected to interact
                        with each other according to a new set of rules which none of us fully understands”. The
                        hallmark of this quote is that these new rules are quite immaterial (and I would argue that it’s
                        because that they are still being written) so I can’t go into what rule this TikTok is
                        establishing, but I can talk about the ones it’s breaking. </p>
                    <p class="paragraph-align-left container">
                        Starting from before TikTok, companies are a multi personal conglomerate, so its representation
                        has been one of cool professionalism. Certainly the biggest scandals in business has been when
                        one person has take to representing the company in a manner not befitting the ideals and the
                        true values of everyone in the company and society at large. Leading to their quick expulsion
                        and an apology generated by a new united front of the company.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph-align-left container">
                        The public on the other hand finds it hard to relate to business who talk to them behind their
                        cool grey walls. Like a bad long distance relationship it’s just hard to relate to someone who
                        is interacting with you in clipped words and through a medium. So it's little wonder that they
                        go and cheat on them all the time. Can’t be loyal (or in a healthy relationship ) with something
                        that feels likes ChatBot Ai.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph-align-left container">
                        Interestingly enough with the emergence of social media there has been a cultural shift in these
                        “talks over the wall”. Companies found customers to be more loyal when they respond like an
                        actual person. Social media became the window into which the company could show case their
                        humanity and interact with the public sphere. No longer are organizations untouchable entities,
                        with social media you can DM Corporate Disney, and tweet at Wendy’s and get a response. Then
                        came TikTok.</p>
                    <P class="paragraph-align-left container">
                        Young millennials and the growing generation of Gen Z began collaborating and colonizing the app
                        like mold on an unchecked sandwich in the back of the fridge. They started creating a place for
                        popular culture to be created and destroyed in witty comments and video recreations. While not
                        always so dingy, it has become quite niche. Virality becomes a competition in the strange and
                        robust. So when the corporate form descended on TikTok they knew they needed to adjust or they
                        weren’t going to survive.</P>
                    <P class="paragraph-align-left container">
                        This leads us to the Duolingo mascot twerking. In its history Duolingo has been on the forefront
                        of this cultural convergence. This video is one of many, that pick up on the popular hashtags
                        and viral content being created within and without the application, and recreating it. They
                        generate content that seems a little too tongue-in-cheek for something that was a”cold walled”
                        organization. Seems weird that suddenly this nonhuman corporation is generating content
                        comparable to tween girls, but the reaction has been news-worthy. I have even started following
                        them on the platform, because simply the cold culture is no more. It’s been combined into the
                        public sphere of instant access and companies have forgone the walls and instead have captured
                        the eye of the people with their humanity.</P>
                    <p class="paragraph-align-left container">
                        In my analysis the culture shift has been one of separation to a literal overlay of the two
                        spheres together. The publics have turned to organizations for content like they turn to their
                        own friends, not for press releases but for popular culture commentary. With technology you can
                        now twerk along with the best, including your new friends at Duolingo. Informality has won over
                        the cultural divide, and humanity has been taking to the big brick buildings on the hill.

                        I was recently watching an animated classic with a group composed of my roommates, and
                        neighbors. The story is about the missing Russian princess and the tale of her discovery. Within
                        the film, you interact with many characters, with one thing in common. They are all white. You
                        don’t notice it really, at least I didn’t until they get to Paris. The clip attached shows the
                        whole song but the most impressionable part starts 13 seconds in. Here is where we see a
                        darker-skinned character in a banana skirt walking a wild cat (maybe a Cheetah based on spot
                        shape). In terms of uniqueness, this character stands out and that seems to be the point. She
                        feels novel and exotic sporting tropical fruit and a wild animal in the streets of Paris. Even
                        for us watching, we notice it and feel it like it’s a circus show on the streets. This plays
                        into the novelties of race, the danger (symbolic in the Cheetah), and the foreign nature of
                        those who come from places different than us.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph-align-left container">
                        This movie was released in 1997 and you could argue we have come a long way when it comes to
                        Hollywood and whitewashing media, but we still do this. Gods of Egypt a movie released in 2016
                        was criticized for the same thing. Even Bullet Train released in 2022, set in Tokyo was notably
                        lacking. “Unless you saw the individual character posters, you’d be unlikely to think Bullet
                        Train actually stars any Asian talent” (Francisco, 2022). Bullet Train’s problem adds more to
                        our conversation than Gods of Egypt does because Bullet Train had multiple racial actors
                        involved in the main cast. It shares with our cat-walking character that their race and culture
                        have been white-washed and served on a palatable platter. Bullet Train played to stereotypes of
                        Japanese Anime and Anastasia did the same. It made the two Japanese actors and black circus
                        characters trivial and almost magical through the simplification of cultural iconography. In our
                        modern world, the representation often looks like Bullet Train. Taking the culture of different
                        races and then shelling the race part out of it. Taking the shell and making it more tolerable
                        for white audiences.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph-align-left container">
                        This has been happening for centuries, from Minstrel shows of the pre-Jim Crow era to now with
                        hype beasts collecting street culture. Capitalism has taken what identities of other races, and
                        their culture, and turned them into profit because of public demand. Supreme and other big
                        brands built their entire empire on revamping street style that has deep roots in the Harlem
                        Renaissance. We represent race in the same ways by building movies and characters upon the
                        opportunity to use their culture for comedy, mysticism, and elevation. Almost like a spice
                        cabinet, the media has been using races as a flavor to bring some depth, but it often misses the
                        mark. “Whitewashing” as it were is frankly irresponsible. Identity isn’t something you can
                        candy-pick and maximize. Race and culture should be interconnected responsibly and with respect.
                        Culture is not always tied to race, but ethnicity isn’t something you get a free pass to use.
                    <p class="paragraph-align-left container">In the end, the media has made a game of using ethnicity
                        for intrigue and applying it to the
                        “woke” crowd. In their attempts to generate new content, they have continued the age-old
                        tradition of pandering culture like a traveling circus. It's what has worked in the past, it
                        worked for Anastasia. It made the city of Paris seem to be the wild exotic place they wanted it
                        to be. The Bullet Train had the excitement of foreign danger, with ninjas and anime cats. The
                        problem is that when you take people out of the culture like Bullet train it feels like
                        appropriation. No matter who is in the cast. If you push character stereotypes like in
                        Anastasia, you create hierarchy and continue the idea that other cultures are simple facades and
                        playthings you can order from a tent. Representation in media it seems can’t win with the ethics
                        we have today.
                    <p class="paragraph-align-left container">The problems that we are facing today have the same roots
                        as they did back in
                        1997 because we haven’t solved those. The media reflects the bigger fault of our society and the
                        demand for entertainment must be reflective to be relevant. It turns to us as people to demand
                        more from entertainment like Newton Minow and find the Golden mean in our representation of each
                        other to get to a place of true equality. To survive the woke generation media must make sure
                        what they are doing isn’t sterilizing other people and their identities, but also showcasing
                        each other’s identities as things that are substantial not a roadshow. This will require a deep
                        journey into the space between the two options and for people to be active in the conversation.

                    <p class="paragraph-align-left container">In the future and going forward media should not create
                        one character that fulfills stereotypes
                        but multiple that challenges bias. That is the closest to the Golden Mean that I can see. It
                        then becomes the media’s job to impress the people into tackling the issues that society needs
                        to overcome. We need to rethink the importance of the role of race and the representation of
                        ethnicity as more than just toys. People need to be people, and culture is important to them.
                        Things won't work if we keep that out of our minds.</p>
