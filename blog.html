                        Used mostly as a social media for the common man TikTok has begun to add corporations and
                        politicians to its platform. The application started off as a sort of revamped karaoke machine,
                        encouraging informality and the combination of song and video. Not the sort of place you would
                        find organizations who have traditionally tried to maintain a formal presence. So you can see
                        why seeing a major organizations mascot twerking dressed as Shrek has made people pause. The
                        motivations for such an act I would argue, seem to be deeply rooted in various forms of
                        convergence that have garnered both respect and trepidation to the company and changed the
                        culture of professional relationships between the public and companies.</p>

                        In his book Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide, Henry Jenkins says talking
                        about our society, “In this emerging media system, what might traditionally be understood as
                        media producers and consumers are transformed into participants who are expected to interact
                        with each other according to a new set of rules which none of us fully understands”. The
                        hallmark of this quote is that these new rules are quite immaterial (and I would argue that it’s
                        because that they are still being written) so I can’t go into what rule this TikTok is
                        establishing, but I can talk about the ones it’s breaking. </p>

                        Starting from before TikTok, companies are a multi personal conglomerate, so its representation
                        has been one of cool professionalism. Certainly the biggest scandals in business has been when
                        one person has take to representing the company in a manner not befitting the ideals and the
                        true values of everyone in the company and society at large. Leading to their quick expulsion
                        and an apology generated by a new united front of the company.</p>

                        The public on the other hand finds it hard to relate to business who talk to them behind their
                        cool grey walls. Like a bad long distance relationship it’s just hard to relate to someone who
                        is interacting with you in clipped words and through a medium. So it's little wonder that they
                        go and cheat on them all the time. Can’t be loyal (or in a healthy relationship ) with something
                        that feels likes ChatBot Ai.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph-align-left container">
                        Interestingly enough with the emergence of social media there has been a cultural shift in these
                        “talks over the wall”. Companies found customers to be more loyal when they respond like an
                        actual person. Social media became the window into which the company could show case their
                        humanity and interact with the public sphere. No longer are organizations untouchable entities,
                        with social media you can DM Corporate Disney, and tweet at Wendy’s and get a response. Then
                        came TikTok.</p>
                        <P class="paragraph-align-left container">
                        Young millennials and the growing generation of Gen Z began collaborating and colonizing the app
                        like mold on an unchecked sandwich in the back of the fridge. They started creating a place for
                        popular culture to be created and destroyed in witty comments and video recreations. While not
                        always so dingy, it has become quite niche. Virality becomes a competition in the strange and
                        robust. So when the corporate form descended on TikTok they knew they needed to adjust or they
                        weren’t going to survive.</P>
                        <P class="paragraph-align-left container">
                        This leads us to the Duolingo mascot twerking. In its history Duolingo has been on the forefront
                        of this cultural convergence. This video is one of many, that pick up on the popular hashtags
                        and viral content being created within and without the application, and recreating it. They
                        generate content that seems a little too tongue-in-cheek for something that was a”cold walled”
                        organization. Seems weird that suddenly this nonhuman corporation is generating content
                        comparable to tween girls, but the reaction has been news-worthy. I have even started following
                        them on the platform, because simply the cold culture is no more. It’s been combined into the
                        public sphere of instant access and companies have forgone the walls and instead have captured
                        the eye of the people with their humanity.</P>
                        <p class="paragraph-align-left container">
                        In my analysis the culture shift has been one of separation to a literal overlay of the two
                        spheres together. The publics have turned to organizations for content like they turn to their
                        own friends, not for press releases but for popular culture commentary. With technology you can
                        now twerk along with the best, including your new friends at Duolingo. Informality has won over
                        the cultural divide, and humanity has been taking to the big brick buildings on the hill.

                        Interestingly enough with the emergence of social media there has been a cultural shift in these
                        “talks over the wall”. Companies found customers to be more loyal when they respond like an
                        actual person. Social media became the window into which the company could show case their
                        humanity and interact with the public sphere. No longer are organizations untouchable entities,
                        with social media you can DM Corporate Disney, and tweet at Wendy’s and get a response. Then
                        came TikTok.</p>

                        Young millennials and the growing generation of Gen Z began collaborating and colonizing the app
                        like mold on an unchecked sandwich in the back of the fridge. They started creating a place for
                        popular culture to be created and destroyed in witty comments and video recreations. While not
                        always so dingy, it has become quite niche. Virality becomes a competition in the strange and
                        robust. So when the corporate form descended on TikTok they knew they needed to adjust or they
                        weren’t going to survive.</P>

                        This leads us to the Duolingo mascot twerking. In its history Duolingo has been on the forefront
                        of this cultural convergence. This video is one of many, that pick up on the popular hashtags
                        and viral content being created within and without the application, and recreating it. They
                        generate content that seems a little too tongue-in-cheek for something that was a”cold walled”
                        organization. Seems weird that suddenly this nonhuman corporation is generating content
                        comparable to tween girls, but the reaction has been news-worthy. I have even started following
                        them on the platform, because simply the cold culture is no more. It’s been combined into the
                        public sphere of instant access and companies have forgone the walls and instead have captured
                        the eye of the people with their humanity.</P>

                        In my analysis the culture shift has been one of separation to a literal overlay of the two
                        spheres together. The publics have turned to organizations for content like they turn to their
                        own friends, not for press releases but for popular culture commentary. With technology you can
                        now twerk along with the best, including your new friends at Duolingo. Informality has won over
                        the cultural divide, and humanity has been taking to the big brick buildings on the hill.
